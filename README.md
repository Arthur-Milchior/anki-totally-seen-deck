Add-on number 852406763

This add-on adds a button which allows you to see the list of decks
which are entirely seen.

If a deck is entirely seen, its children are not shown in the list.

The reason I wanted this deck is the following: when a deck is
entirely seen, it mostly means that it is time for me to add new cards
in this deck. Since I've got more than 400 decks, with a lot of
sub-sub-sub...decks this add-ons allows me to see which decks need attention.
